There are four pieces of R codes for this paper. 

Subgroup analysis R code: 

  &nbsp; The R code was used to conduct the subgroup analysis (large p - scenario 1, Section 3.1, Figure 1, Table 1).
 
Simulation R code: 

    &nbsp;The R code was used to conduct the simulation study on variable importance (Section 3.2, Table 1, Figure 2-4).

Interpretation case analysis R code: 
   
    &nbsp;The R code was used to conduct the analysis (large p -scenario 2, Section 3.3, Figure 5, Table 2).
 
Imbalanced data analysis R code: 

    &nbsp;The R code was used to conduct real case analysis on imbalanced outcome data (Section 3.4, Figure 7, Table 3).
 
The single tree visualization in the paper was conducted in the R package rattle, code at bottom of this file
